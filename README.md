## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning library
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have latest Python version installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## 📦 Installation

Each project folder contains its own detailed installation instructions. Generally, you'll need:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

For specific project requirements, check the individual project folders.

## 💻 Usage

Navigate to any project folder and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
cd House_Price_Prediction
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
```

Or run Python scripts directly:

```bash
python main.py
```

Each project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing scripts
- Model training and evaluation code
- Visualization and results analysis
- Saved model files (where applicable)
