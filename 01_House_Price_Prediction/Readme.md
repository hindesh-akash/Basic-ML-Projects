# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices from the **California Housing Dataset**.

## 📌 Features Used
- Median Income
- House Age
- Average Rooms and Bedrooms
- Population and Occupancy
- Latitude and Longitude

## 🔍 Project Steps
1. Load California Housing data
2. Perform EDA with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
3. Train a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate performance using MSE and R²
5. Save the trained model with `pickle`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hindesh-akash/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
